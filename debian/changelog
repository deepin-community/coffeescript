    + Internal compiler names no longer start with underscores.
    + Minor bug fixes and various improvements to compiler error
      messages.
    + Supports Literate CoffeeScript.
    + The CoffeeScript REPL is now based on the Node.js REPL, and should

    + Returning explicit values from constructors is now forbidden. If
      you want to return an arbitrary value, use a function, not a
      constructor.
    + You can now loop over an array backwards, without having to
      manually deal with the indexes.
    + Source locations are now preserved in the CoffeeScript AST,
      although source maps are not yet being emitted.
    + Can generate source maps. Pass the --map flag to the compiler, and
